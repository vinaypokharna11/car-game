# 🎮 How to Play

* **Goal:** Navigate the car from the left side of the track to the white finish line on the right without hitting any obstacles.
* **Controls:**

  * `ArrowUp` – Move up
  * `ArrowDown` – Move down
  * `ArrowLeft` – Move left
  * `ArrowRight` – Move right

# Gameplay Features

* Moving Obstacles: Five colored blocks move vertically at varying speeds and delays to challenge your reflexes.
* Collision Detection: Crashing into an obstacle triggers a "Game Over" prompt with the option to restart.
* Finish Line: Crossing the white bar at the right edge triggers a victory prompt with the option to play again.

# 🛠️ Customization

* Styling: Update colors, sizes, or animations in `style.css`.
* Game Logic: Tweak speeds, collision thresholds, or add new obstacle types in `script.js`.
* Assets: Replace `car.png` with your own sprite (ensure the same dimensions or adjust CSS accordingly).
